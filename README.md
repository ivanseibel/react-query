# Description

I'm trying out a different and productive way to work with data fetch in React using the `react-query` library.

**CRUD operations I want to implement**

1. Fetch all products
2. Fetch a specific product
3. Add a new product
4. Edit a product
5. Delete a product

About the API... I'm thinking to start with JSON Server and spend less time with integrations or building my own API, to concentrate more effort on my experiment. Maybe I can move to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or [supabase](https://supabase.io/) later.
