## About <a name = "about"></a>

I'm trying out a different and productive way to work with data fetch in React using the `react-query` library.

In this project I will test the `react-query` library implementing the following features:

**User List**
- User Listing
- Paging with navigation and limit
- Combined filters
- Ordering

**User detail**
- Retrieve cached data from a user id.

Please don't judge me by the poor interface, the focus of this project is on validating the library and not building a pretty application ðŸ˜‡

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Most likely, you won't have to install npm separately, as it is often bundled with Node.js.

For simplicity and flexibility with the Node.js versions you can also choose to install a version manager for Node.js, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

If you want to use the same dataset I used from a JSON file, you will also have to install [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

### Installing

After getting Node.js and npm, run the following command to install all project dependencies into the `node_modules` folder.

```bash
# npm install
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

If you choose to use `json-server` to emulate a real API you will need to run the script that initializes the API first.

```bash
# npm run mock
```

An important detail here, don't be alarmed by the delay in responses from `json-server`. To get a clear sense of the effect of `react-query` caching I added a 2 second delay. You can adjust this in the `package.json` file in the scripts section.

After that, just run the application to access the main screen and be able to browse the features.

```bash
# npm start
```

You should see a screen similar to the one below.

## Conclusions <a name = "about"></a>

I personally have a bit of resistance to using this kind of "out of the box" solution because I like to understand what's going on behind the scenes while I'm communicating with the APIs.

However, I have to say that `react-query` positively surprised me, it provided a way to maintain a global server state context and also provided an excellent caching solution with minimal configuration.

Also, something that caught my attention was the few lines needed to get everything up and running, once you have a service model for getting the data using `react-query`, adding new calls will be extremely productive.

Caching features are very useful and easy to use, and you would be surprised how powerful they can be within an application that seeks to be both performant and functional.

I'm seriously considering using `react-query` in a few more projects to see how it fares in a production environment.

As far as the project documentation is concerned, it's really extensive, but I missed beginning-middle-end examples, mainly involving typescript. Documentation for typescript can be improved.
